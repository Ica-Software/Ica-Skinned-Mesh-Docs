# Current Caveats

- Normal recompute is equivalent of “legacy with split tangents” and not “mikktspace”

- Ica Skinner has higher Vram usage than SMR **

- Nothing is cached in pre built, this results higher startup initialization time **

- Ica Skinner has different performance characteristics (could be better or worse) **

- API is not stable *

- 4 Bones per Vertex Only *

- Not all SMR api methods provided in Ica Skinner *

- Verlet Physics still in experimental state *

- Tension compute still in experimental state *

(*) Planned to be fixed or improved.
(**) These may be fixed if I can convince Unity to make some improvements in the engine.
